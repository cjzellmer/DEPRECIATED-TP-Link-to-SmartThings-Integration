Upgrade notes from version 2.0

Version 2.1.	General update to add bridge capability.  This adds a 
			"bridge" device. Through the bridge, you can monitor the
			status of the Node.js applications and also RESTART the
			bridge.

Version 2.2	Integrated the parameter "ignore_default" into the
			commands.  Allows sending of on along with other
			parameters, reducing number of commands sent.

Version 2.3	Fixed problem with Alexa Voice Command changes.  These
			changed to provide brightnes with decimals (i.e., 10.1 
			versus 10).  The bulbs reject 10.0 and set the bulb to
			0 brightness (lowest dim level).
