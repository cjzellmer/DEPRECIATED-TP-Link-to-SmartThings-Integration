1.  Copy the files in the directory to a new directory on your PC.
2.  Edit the "TPLinkServerLite.bat" to identify the path to your server.
3.  Open the appropriate ".groovy" file and copy the contents to your clipboard.
4.  Log in to SmartThings IDE, then go to "My Device Handlers".
5.  Open the CURRENT device handler.  Select the text and delete it. Then paste
    the text from your clipboard into the window.
